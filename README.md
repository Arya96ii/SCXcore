SCXcore is the Operations Manager UNIX/Linux Agent, typically used for
Operations Manager, but is also used in a host of other products as
well.

The SCXcore provides a CIMOM provider, based on [OMI][], to return
logging and statistical information for a UNIX or Linux system. The
SCXcore provider runs on AIX 6.1 and later, HP/UX 11.31 and later,
Solaris 5.10 and later, and most versions of Linux as far back as
RedHat 5.0, SuSE 10.1, and Debian 5.0.
