2.8 SCX\_StatisticalInformation  
This is a base class for two other classes defined below. It defines one
local property defined below. See the superclass for a description of
inherited features.  
  
2.8.1 IsAggregate  
True if data is aggregated from several instances.  
  
2.9 SCX\_ProcessorStatisticalInformation  
Instances of this class capture statistical information about processors
on the current system. An instance is defined for each processor and an
additional instance is defined that aggregates statiscial information
about all processors. The following instance was obtained from a
dual-processor Linux system and has statistical information about the
first processor.  
  
IsAggregate = FALSE  
Caption = "Processor information"  
Description = "CPU usage statistics"  
Name = "0"  
PercentIdleTime = 0  
PercentUserTime = 0  
PercentNiceTime = 0  
PercentPrivilegedTime = 0  
PercentInterruptTime = 0  
PercentDPCTime = 0  
PercentProcessorTime = 100  
PercentIOWaitTime = 0  
  
A second instance has the following properties.  
  
IsAggregate = FALSE  
Caption = "Processor information"  
Description = "CPU usage statistics"  
Name = "1"  
PercentIdleTime = 0  
PercentUserTime = 0  
PercentNiceTime = 0  
PercentPrivilegedTime = 0  
PercentInterruptTime = 0  
PercentDPCTime = 0  
PercentProcessorTime = 100  
PercentIOWaitTime = 0  
  
And finally, a third instance aggregates these two instances and is
shown below (note that IsAggregate is TRUE).  
  
IsAggregate = TRUE  
Caption = "Processor information"  
Description = "CPU usage statistics"  
Name = "\_Total"  
PercentIdleTime = 0  
PercentUserTime = 0  
PercentNiceTime = 0  
PercentPrivilegedTime = 0  
PercentInterruptTime = 0  
PercentDPCTime = 0  
PercentProcessorTime = 100

**3 Configuration Files**

XPlatProviders uses the following two configuration files.  
  
{confdir}/scxlog.conf  
{confdir}/scxrunas.conf  
  
These are discussed in the sections below.  
  
3.1 scxlog.conf  
This configuration file controls the provider logging facility. By
default, all provider logging is directed to {logdir}/log/scx.log. The
default logging threshold is \`WARNING'. The scxlog.conf file can
redirect logging to multiple files and it may control the logging
threshold for those files. For example, consider the following file.  
  
FILE (  
PATH: /opt/xplatproviders/log/log1  
MODULE: WARNING  
MODULE: scx.core.providers TRACE  
)  
FILE (  
PATH: /opt/xplatproviders/log/log2  
MODULE: WARNING  
MODULE: scx.core.common TRACE  
)  
  
This log has two sections. Each section sends logging output to a
specific file. The first section directs log output to
/opt/xplatproviders/log/myfile. TRACE severity log messages are logged
for the logging module called scx.core.providers. For the \`root' module
(everything else), only WARNING severity log messages are logged. Any
section may have multiple module lines.  
  
The logging severities are as follows.  
  
ERROR - The system could not perform the task it was supposed to
perform. Contact support.  
WARNING - Abnormal behavior that could be handled.  
INFORMATION - Information that is useful to someone trying to figure out
the general state of the application. Example: Successful
initialization.  
TRACE - Information that is useful to someone trying to follow general
program execution flow.  
HYSTERICAL - Information that is useful to someone trying to follow very
detailed program execution flow. This level will normally only be used
for finding and fixing bugs and in those cases only for small modules.  
SUPPRESS - It must be possible to suppress messages using a severity
threshold that is higher than any log message can have.  
The logging modules are listed here.  
  
scx  
scx.core  
scx.core.common  
scx.core.common.pal  
scx.core.common.pal.os  
scx.core.common.pal.os.filepath  
scx.core.common.pal.os.filestream  
scx.core.common.pal.system  
scx.core.common.pal.system.common  
scx.core.common.pal.system.common.entityenumeration  
scx.core.common.pal.system.common.entityinstance  
scx.core.common.pal.system.cpu.cpuenumeration  
scx.core.common.pal.system.cpu.cpuinstance  
scx.core.common.util  
scx.core.common.util.math  
scx.core.common.util.stringaid  
scx.core.providers  
scx.core.providers.cpu  
scx.core.providersupport  
scx.core.providersupport.cmpibase  
  
These are arranged in a hierarcy, so specifiying scx.core.providers also
affects the following modules (of which scx.core.providers is a
prefix).  
  
scx.core.providers  
scx.core.providers.cpu  
scx.core.providersupport  
scx.core.providersupport.cmpibase  
  
3.2 scxrunas.conf  
This configuration file controls the execution of the following
extrinsic methods (described above).  
  
SCX\_OperatingSystem.ExecuteCommand()  
SCX\_OperatingSystem.ExecuteShellCommand()  
SCX\_OperatingSystem.ExecuteScript()  
  
The SCX\_OperatingSystem provider runs in its own agent process. The
process owner is the same as the user that initiated the CIM client
request. The three methods above spawn a new process to execute the
command or script. This configuration file controls three options that
affect this new process. The following scxrunas.conf file has the
default settings (the settings used if the file is empty or missing).  
  
AllowRoot=false  
ChRootPath=  
CWD=/opt/xplatproviders/run  
  
The AllowRoot option indicates whether the process may execute as root.
By default it cannot. The ChRootPath, if non-empty, is the path on which
a chroot system call is performed immediately after creating the process
but before executing the command or script. By default ChRootPath is
empty, indicating that no chroot is performed. The CWD option is the
directory that the process executes in. By default it is the same as the
{rundir} configured during installation.
